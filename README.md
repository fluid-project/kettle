# Kettle

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/8715d7bc790b1c2702109d3ce2b777fe5322c858465e587478.svg)](https://buildkite.com/fluid-project/kettle)

Kettle is an integration technology which promotes the expression of servers handling HTTP and WebSockets endpoints.
With a few exceptions, Kettle implements no primary functionality of its own, but aggregates the facilities of
[express](http://expressjs.com/) and [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws), as well as middleware held in the wider
[pillarjs](https://github.com/pillarjs) "Bring your own HTTP Framework Framework" ecosystem. Kettle applications can
easily incorporate any express-standard middleware, as well as coexisting with standard express apps targeted at the
same node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_server"><code>http.Server</code></a>. Since
Kettle applications are expressed declaratively, in the JSON format encoding
[Infusion](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion)'s component trees, it is possible to adapt existing
applications easily, as well as inserting middleware and new handlers anywhere in the pipeline without modifying the
original application's code. This makes Kettle suitable for uses where application functionality needs to be deployed
flexibly in a variety of different configurations.

In fact, Kettle's dependency on express itself is minimal, since the entirety of the Kettle request handling pipeline
is packaged as a single piece of express-compatible middleware – Kettle could be deployed against any other consumer
of middleware or even a raw node.js HTTP server.

## Notes on Kettle 2.x releases

The 2.x line of Kettle releases are (at the time of writing) still code-compatible with the 1.x releases in terms of
support for user code, but the 2.x Kettle releases break compatibility with older versions of Infusion (1.x through
3.x). Kettle 1.x has been compatible with mainline releases of Infusion as well as those from in-progress
FLUID-6145 and FLUID-6148 branches. Kettle 2.x releases are only compatible with 4.x releases of Infusion (and
historically, those from the FLUID-6145 branch, newer than and including
3.0.0-dev.20200930T151056Z.d0b9e348d.FLUID-6145 ).

## Contents of this repository

### Core Kettle implementation

This is packaged as Infusion [grades](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ComponentGrades.html) derived
from [`kettle.server`](./docs/Servers.md#kettle.server),
[`kettle.request`](./docs/RequestHandlersAndApps.md#kettle.request) and
[`kettle.app`](./docs/RequestHandlersAndApps.md#kettle.app). The first two of these exist in variants specialized both
for plain HTTP (with the `.http` suffix) and for WebSockets (with the `.ws` suffix) – `kettle.app` does not specialize.

### Contents - Testing

As well as the integration technology implementing Kettle itself, this repository also contains functionality helpful
for testing HTTP and WebSockets servers written in arbitrary technologies. This is accessed by running
`kettle.loadTestingSupport()` after having called `require("kettle")`. Kettle testing support allows HTTP and
WebSockets client requests to be packaged as [Infusion](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion) components, suitable
for use with Infusion's
[IoC Testing Framework](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCTestingFramework.html).
Any user of Kettle's testing support needs to have [node-jqunit](https://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqunit)
registered as a member of their own project's `devDependencies` in their own package.json.

Kettle runs on [node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 14.x and upward (see [package.json](package.json) for current
dependency profile).

### Contents - DataSources

The Kettle repository also contains a few implementations of the simple `DataSource` contract for read/write access to
data with a simple semantic (broadly the same as that encoded in
[CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) although the current DataSource semantic does not
provide explicitly for deletion). See the documentation section on [DataSources](./docs/DataSources.md) for details of
this contract, the available implementations and how to use them.

This repository contains DataSource implementations suitable for HTTP endpoints (with a particular variety specialised
for accessing CouchDB databases with CRUDlike semantics) as well as the filesystem, with an emphasis on JSON payloads.

### Uses of Kettle and related projects

The primary user of Kettle is the [GPII](http://gpii.net/)'s autopersonalisation infrastructure, held at
[GPII/universal](https://github.com/GPII/universal). Kettle is used to provide a flexible means of deploying the
GPII's "Flow Manager" and related components distributed across multiple local and remote installations.

A closely related project to Kettle is [gpii-express](https://github.com/GPII/gpii-express) which is used in other
GPII projects such as the [terms registry](https://github.com/GPII/common-terms-registry) and
[unified listing](https://github.com/GPII/ul-api). This is similar in architecture to Kettle (wrapping express
primitives such as servers and requests into dynamically constructed Infusion components) but slightly different in
emphasis –

* gpii-express allows independently mounted application units with nested routing, in the Express 4.x style – whereas
  Kettle is currently limited to flat Express 3.x-style routing
* Kettle incorporates support for WebSockets endpoints, whereas gpii-express does not
* Kettle incorporates support for DataSources (see [DataSources](./docs/DataSources.md) )

The request handling architecture for gpii-express and Kettle is quite similar and the projects will probably converge
over time. gpii-express currently already depends on Kettle to get access to its HTTP
[testing](./docs/KettleTestingFramework.md) support.

## Documentation

Documentation and sample code for working with Kettle is contained in the [docs](./docs) directory. Kettle is based on
Fluid [Infusion](http://fluidproject.org/infusion.html)'s
[component model](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/HowToUseInfusionIoC.html). If you aren't familiar
with the syntax and meaning of Infusion component trees, it is a good idea to browse the documentation, tutorials and
examples at the Infusion [documentation site](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/).

It contains the following topics:

1. Defining top-level [Kettle applications using "config" files](docs/ConfigsAndApplications.md).
2. Defining HTTP and Websockets servers using the grades [`kettle.server`](./docs/Servers.md#kettle.server) and
   [`kettle.server.ws`](./docs/Servers.md#kettle.server.ws).
3. Defining Kettle request handlers derived from grades
   [`kettle.request`](./docs/RequestHandlersAndApps.md#kettle.request) grouped into app units derived from
   [`kettle.app`](./docs/RequestHandlersAndApps.md#kettle.app)
4. Working with standard express [middleware](./docs/Middleware.md) –  incorporating any standard middleware from the
   express community and registering it into a Kettle application
5. Working with [DataSources](./docs/DataSources.md) to abstract over asynchronous access to (primarily JSON-formatted)
   data stored locally or remotely
6. Defining conversational, asynchronous test fixtures against HTTP and WebSockets servers using the [Kettle testing
   framework](./docs/KettleTestingFramework.md)

Of these elements of this module, those described in topics 1, 5 and 6 (configs, DataSources and the testing framework)
are portable and do not depend specifically on the Kettle server and request handling infrastructure –   they can be
used together with any technologies defining node.js HTTP and WebSockets servers (or in the case of configs,
any node.js enabled [Infusion](http://fluidproject.org/infusion.html) application).
